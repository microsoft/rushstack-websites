The TSDoc projects are coordinated by the [Rush Stack](https://rushstack.io/) group at Microsoft.

Although Microsoft does not provide official support for TSDoc, there are community options for help:

- **Found a bug?** Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc/issues)

- **Problem with the website?** Create your issue under
  the [tsdoc.org-website](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc.org-website/issues) GitHub project

- **Zulip chat:** The Rush Stack chat server hosts a [#tsdoc](https://rushstack.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/266672-tsdoc)
  stream where you can contact the project maintainers. For help with getting a PR merged, try the
  [#contributor-helpline](https://rushstack.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/279883-contributor-helpline) stream.
