Disable caching for this operation. The operation will never be restored from cache. This may be useful if this operation affects state outside of its folder.

This option is only used when the build cache is enabled for the repo. You can set disableBuildCacheForOperation=true to disable caching for a specific project operation. This is a useful workaround if that project's build scripts violate the assumptions of the cache, for example by writing files outside the project folder. Where possible, a better solution is to improve the build scripts to be compatible with caching.

**Signature:**

```typescript
disableBuildCacheForOperation?: boolean;
```
