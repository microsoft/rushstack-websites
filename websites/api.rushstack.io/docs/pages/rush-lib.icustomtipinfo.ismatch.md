The function to determine how to match this tipId.

**Signature:**

```typescript
isMatch?: (str: string) => boolean;
```

## Remarks

This function might need to be updated if the depending package is updated. For example, if `pnpm` change the error logs for "ERR\_PNPM\_NO\_MATCHING\_VERSION", we will need to update the match function accordingly.
