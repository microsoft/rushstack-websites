The filename ("nonbrowser-approved-packages.json") for an optional policy configuration file that stores a list of NPM packages that have been approved for usage by Rush projects. This is part of a pair of config files, one for projects that run in a web browser (e.g. whose approval criteria mostly focuses on licensing and code size), and one for everywhere else (e.g. tooling projects whose approval criteria mostly focuses on avoiding node\_modules sprawl).

**Signature:**

```typescript
static readonly nonbrowserApprovedPackagesFilename: 'nonbrowser-approved-packages.json';
