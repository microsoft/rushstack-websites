## IHeftLifecycleHooks.recordMetrics property

The `recordMetrics` hook is called at the end of every Heft execution pass. It is called after all phases have completed execution (or been canceled). In a watch run, it will be called several times in between `toolStart` and (if the session is gracefully interrupted via Ctrl+C), `toolFinish`<></>. In a non-watch run, it will be invoked exactly once between `toolStart` and `toolFinish`<></>. To use it, call `recordMetrics.tapPromise(<pluginName>, <callback>)`<></>.

**Signature:**

```typescript
recordMetrics: AsyncParallelHook<IHeftRecordMetricsHookOptions>;
```
