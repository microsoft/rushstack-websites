## OperationExecutionManager class

A class which manages the execution of a set of tasks with interdependencies. Initially, and at the end of each task execution, all unblocked tasks are added to a ready queue which is then executed. This is done continually until all tasks are complete, or prematurely fails if any of the tasks fail.

```typescript
export declare class OperationExecutionManager<TOperationMetadata extends {} = {}, TGroupMetadata extends {} = {}>
