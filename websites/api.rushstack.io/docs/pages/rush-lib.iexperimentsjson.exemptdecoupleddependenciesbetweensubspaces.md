## IExperimentsJson.exemptDecoupledDependenciesBetweenSubspaces property

Rush has a policy that normally requires Rush projects to specify `workspace:*` in package.json when depending on other projects in the workspace, unless they are explicitly declared as `decoupledLocalDependencies` in rush.json. Enabling this experiment will remove that requirement for dependencies belonging to a different subspace. This is useful for large product groups who work in separate subspaces and generally prefer to consume each other's packages via the NPM registry.

**Signature:**

```typescript
exemptDecoupledDependenciesBetweenSubspaces?: boolean;
```
