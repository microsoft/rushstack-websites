## CobuildConfiguration.cobuildFeatureEnabled property

> This API is provided as a beta preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

Indicates whether the cobuild feature is enabled. Typically it is enabled in the cobuild.json config file.

Note: The orchestrator (or local users) should always have to opt into running with cobuilds by providing a cobuild context id. Even if cobuilds are "enabled" as a feature, they don't actually turn on for that particular build unless the cobuild context id is provided as an non-empty string.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly cobuildFeatureEnabled: boolean;
```
