## IOperationSettings.dependsOnEnvVars property

> This API is provided as an alpha preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

An optional list of environment variables that can affect this operation. The values of these environment variables will become part of the hash when reading and writing the build cache.

Note: generally speaking, all environment variables available to Rush are also available to any operations performed -- Rush assumes that environment variables do not affect build outputs unless you list them here.

**Signature:**

```typescript
dependsOnEnvVars?: string[];
```
