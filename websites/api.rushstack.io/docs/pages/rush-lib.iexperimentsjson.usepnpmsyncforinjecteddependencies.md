(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) For certain installation problems involving peer dependencies, PNPM cannot correctly satisfy versioning requirements without installing duplicate copies of a package inside the node\_modules folder. This poses a problem for "workspace:\*" dependencies, as they are normally installed by making a symlink to the local project source folder. PNPM's "injected dependencies" feature provides a model for copying the local project folder into node\_modules, however copying must occur AFTER the dependency project is built and BEFORE the consuming project starts to build. The "pnpm-sync" tool manages this operation; see its documentation for details. Enable this experiment if you want "rush" and "rushx" commands to resync injected dependencies by invoking "pnpm-sync" during the build.

**Signature:**

```typescript
usePnpmSyncForInjectedDependencies?: boolean;
```
