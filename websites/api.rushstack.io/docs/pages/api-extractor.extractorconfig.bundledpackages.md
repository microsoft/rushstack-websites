## ExtractorConfig.bundledPackages property

A list of NPM package names whose exports should be treated as part of this package.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly bundledPackages: string[];
```

## Remarks

Also supports glob patterns. Note: glob patterns will \*\*only\*\* be resolved against dependencies listed in the project's package.json file.

\* This is both a safety and a performance precaution.

Exact package names will be applied against any dependency encountered while walking the type graph, regardless of dependencies listed in the package.json.
