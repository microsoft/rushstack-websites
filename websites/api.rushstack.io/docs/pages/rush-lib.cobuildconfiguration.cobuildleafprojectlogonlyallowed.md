If true, Rush will automatically handle the leaf project with build cache "disabled" by writing to the cache in a special "log files only mode". This is useful when you want to use Cobuilds to improve the performance in CI validations and the leaf projects have not enabled cache.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly cobuildLeafProjectLogOnlyAllowed: boolean;
```
