## ISetWebpackPublicPathOptions.regexVariable property

Check for a variable with this name on the page and use its value as a regular expression against script paths to the bundle's script. If a value foo is passed into regexVariable, the produced bundle will look for a variable called foo during initialization, and if a foo variable is found, use its value as a regular expression to detect the bundle's script.

See the README for more information.

**Signature:**

```typescript
regexVariable?: string;
```
