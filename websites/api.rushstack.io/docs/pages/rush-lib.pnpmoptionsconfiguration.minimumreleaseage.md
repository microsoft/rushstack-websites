## PnpmOptionsConfiguration.minimumReleaseAge property

The minimum number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. This setting helps reduce the risk of installing compromised packages, as malicious releases are typically discovered and removed within a short time frame.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly minimumReleaseAge: number | undefined;
```

## Remarks

(SUPPORTED ONLY IN PNPM 10.16.0 AND NEWER)

PNPM documentation: https://pnpm.io/settings\#minimumreleaseage

The default value is 0 (disabled).
