> 

Returns full path of the temporary shrinkwrap file for a specific subspace and returns the common workspace shrinkwrap if no subspaceName is provided.

**Signature:**

```typescript
getTempShrinkwrapFilename(): string;
```

string

## Remarks

This function takes the subspace name, and returns the full path for the subspace's shrinkwrap file. This function also consults the deprecated option to allow for shrinkwraps to be stored under a package folder. This shrinkwrap file is used during "rush install", and may be rewritten by the package manager during installation This property merely reports the filename, the file itself may not actually exist. example: `C:\MyRepo\common\<subspace_name>\pnpm-lock.yaml`
