## PnpmOptionsConfiguration.globalIgnoredOptionalDependencies property

The ignoredOptionalDependencies setting allows you to exclude certain optional dependencies from being installed during the Rush installation process. This can be useful when optional dependencies are not required or are problematic in specific environments (e.g., dependencies with incompatible binaries or platform-specific requirements). The listed dependencies will be treated as though they are missing, even if other packages specify them as optional dependencies. The settings are copied into the pnpm.ignoredOptionalDependencies field of the common/temp/package.json file that is generated by Rush during installation.

(SUPPORTED ONLY IN PNPM 9.0.0 AND NEWER)
