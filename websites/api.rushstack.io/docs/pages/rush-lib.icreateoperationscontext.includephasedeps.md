## ICreateOperationsContext.includePhaseDeps property

> This API is provided as an alpha preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

If true, Rush will automatically include the dependent phases for the specified set of phases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly includePhaseDeps: boolean;
```

## Remarks

If the selection of projects was "unsafe" (i.e. missing some dependencies), this will add the minimum number of phases required to make it safe.
