## IExperimentsJson.allowCobuildWithoutCache property

Allow cobuilds without using the build cache to store previous execution info. When setting up distributed builds, Rush will allow uncacheable projects to still leverage the cobuild feature. This is useful when you want to speed up operations that can't (or shouldn't) be cached.

**Signature:**

```typescript
allowCobuildWithoutCache?: boolean;
```
