## IExperimentsJson.rushAlerts property

> This API is provided as a beta preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) The Rush alerts feature provides a way to send announcements to engineers working in the monorepo, by printing directly in the user's shell window when they invoke Rush commands. This ensures that important notices will be seen by anyone doing active development, since people often ignore normal discussion group messages or don't know to subscribe.

**Signature:**

```typescript
rushAlerts?: boolean;
```
