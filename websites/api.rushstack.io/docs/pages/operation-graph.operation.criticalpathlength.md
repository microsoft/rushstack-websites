## Operation.criticalPathLength property

This number represents how far away this Operation is from the furthest "root" operation (i.e. an operation with no consumers). This helps us to calculate the critical path (i.e. the longest chain of projects which must be executed in order, thereby limiting execution speed of the entire operation tree.

This number is calculated via a memoized depth-first search, and when choosing the next operation to execute, the operation with the highest criticalPathLength is chosen.

Example: (0) A \\ (1) B C (0) (applications) \\ /\|<></>\\ \\ / \| \\ (2) D \| X (1) (utilities) \| / \\ \|/ \\ (2) Y Z (2) (other utilities)

All roots (A &amp; C) have a criticalPathLength of 0. B has a score of 1, since A depends on it. D has a score of 2, since we look at the longest chain (e.g D-<></>&gt;<></>B-<></>&gt;<></>A is longer than D-<></>&gt;<></>C) X has a score of 1, since the only package which depends on it is A Z has a score of 2, since only X depends on it, and X has a score of 1 Y has a score of 2, since the chain Y-<></>&gt;<></>X-<></>&gt;<></>C is longer than Y-<></>&gt;<></>C

The algorithm is implemented in AsyncOperationQueue.ts as calculateCriticalPathLength()

```typescript
