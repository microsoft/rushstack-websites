## PnpmOptionsConfiguration.resolutionMode property

This setting determines how PNPM chooses version numbers during `rush update`<></>.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly resolutionMode: PnpmResolutionMode | undefined;
```

## Remarks

For example, suppose `lib-x@3.0.0` depends on `"lib-y": "^1.2.3"` whose latest major releases are `1.8.9` and `2.3.4`<></>. The resolution mode `lowest-direct` might choose `lib-y@1.2.3`<></>, wheres `highest` will choose 1.8.9, and `time-based` will pick the highest compatible version at the time when `lib-x@3.0.0` itself was published (ensuring that the version could have been tested by the maintainer of "lib-x"). For local workspace projects, `time-based` instead works like `lowest-direct`<></>, avoiding upgrades unless they are explicitly requested. Although `time-based` is the most robust option, it may be slightly slower with registries such as npmjs.com that have not implemented an optimization.

IMPORTANT: Be aware that PNPM 8.0.0 initially defaulted to `lowest-direct` instead of `highest`<></>, but PNPM reverted this decision in 8.6.12 because it caused confusion for users. Rush version 5.106.0 and newer avoids this confusion by consistently defaulting to `highest` when `resolutionMode` is not explicitly set in pnpm-config.json or .npmrc, regardless of your PNPM version.

PNPM documentation: https://pnpm.io/npmrc\#resolution-mode

Possible values are: `highest`<></>, `time-based`<></>, and `lowest-direct`<></>. The default is `highest`<></>.
