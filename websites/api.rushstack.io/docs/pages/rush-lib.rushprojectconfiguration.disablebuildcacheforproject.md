Disable caching for this project. The project will never be restored from cache. This may be useful if this project affects state outside of its folder.

This option is only used when the build cache is enabled for the repo. You can set disableBuildCacheForProject=true to disable caching for a specific project. This is a useful workaround if that project's build scripts violate the assumptions of the cache, for example by writing files outside the project folder. Where possible, a better solution is to improve the build scripts to be compatible with caching.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly disableBuildCacheForProject: boolean;
```
