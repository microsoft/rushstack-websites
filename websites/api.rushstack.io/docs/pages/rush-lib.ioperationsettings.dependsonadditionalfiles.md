> 

An optional list of glob (minimatch) patterns pointing to files that can affect this operation. The hash values of the contents of these files will become part of the final hash when reading and writing the build cache.

Note: if a particular file will be matched by patterns provided by both `incrementalBuildIgnoredGlobs` and `dependsOnAdditionalFiles` options - `dependsOnAdditionalFiles` will win and the file will be included calculating final hash value when reading and writing the build cache

**Signature:**

```typescript
dependsOnAdditionalFiles?: string[];
```
