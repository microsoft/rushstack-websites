## IExperimentsJson.omitAppleDoubleFilesFromBuildCache property

If true, when running on macOS, Rush will omit AppleDouble files (`._*`<></>) from build cache archives when a companion file exists in the same directory. AppleDouble files are automatically created by macOS to store extended attributes on filesystems that don't support them, and should generally not be included in the shared build cache.

**Signature:**

```typescript
omitAppleDoubleFilesFromBuildCache?: boolean;
```
