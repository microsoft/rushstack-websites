## ILaunchOptions.isManaged property

True if the tool was invoked from within a project with a rush.json file, otherwise false. We consider a project without a rush.json to be "unmanaged" and we'll print that to the command line when the tool is executed. This is mainly used for debugging purposes.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
isManaged: boolean;
```
