## PackageJsonLookup.instance property

A singleton instance of `PackageJsonLookup` , which is useful for short-lived processes that can reasonably assume that the file system will not be modified after the cache is populated.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
static get instance(): PackageJsonLookup;
```

## Remarks

For long-running processes that need to clear the cache at appropriate times, it is recommended to create your own instance of `PackageJsonLookup` instead of relying on this instance.
