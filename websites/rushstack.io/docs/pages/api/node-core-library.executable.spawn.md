## Executable.spawn() method

Start a child process.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
static spawn(filename: string, args: string[], options?: IExecutableSpawnOptions): child_process.ChildProcess;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  filename | string | The name of the executable file. This string must not contain any command-line arguments. If the name contains any path delimiters, then the shell's default PATH will not be searched. |
|  args | string\[\] | The command-line arguments to be passed to the process. |
|  options | [IExecutableSpawnOptions](./node-core-library.iexecutablespawnoptions.md) | Additional options |

<b>Returns:</b>

child\_process.ChildProcess

the same data type as returned by the NodeJS child\_process.spawnSync() API

## Remarks

This function is similar to child\_process.spawn(). The main differences are:

- It does not invoke the OS shell unless the executable file is a shell script. - Command-line arguments containing special characters are more accurately passed through to the child process. - If the filename is missing a path, then the shell's default PATH will be searched. - If the filename is missing a file extension, then Windows default file extensions will be searched.

This command is asynchronous, but it does not return a `Promise` . Instead it returns a Node.js `ChildProcess` supporting event notifications.
