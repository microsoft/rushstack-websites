## ExtractorConfig.projectFolder property

Determines the `<projectFolder>` token that can be used with other config file settings. The project folder typically contains the tsconfig.json and package.json config files, but the path is user-defined.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly projectFolder: string;
```

## Remarks

The path is resolved relative to the folder of the config file that contains the setting.

The default value for `projectFolder` is the token `<lookup>` , which means the folder is determined using the following heuristics:

If the config/rig.json system is used (as defined by [@rushstack/rig-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rushstack/rig-package) ), then the `<lookup>` value will be the package folder that referenced the rig.

Otherwise, the `<lookup>` value is determined by traversing parent folders, starting from the folder containing api-extractor.json, and stopping at the first folder that contains a tsconfig.json file. If a tsconfig.json file cannot be found in this way, then an error will be reported.
