## RushConfiguration.suppressNodeLtsWarning property

Odd-numbered major versions of Node.js are experimental. Even-numbered releases spend six months in a stabilization period before the first Long Term Support (LTS) version. For example, 8.9.0 was the first LTS version of Node.js 8. Pre-LTS versions are not recommended for production usage because they frequently have bugs. They may cause Rush itself to malfunction.

Rush normally prints a warning if it detects a pre-LTS Node.js version. If you are testing pre-LTS versions in preparation for supporting the first LTS version, you can use this setting to disable Rush's warning.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
get suppressNodeLtsWarning(): boolean;
```
