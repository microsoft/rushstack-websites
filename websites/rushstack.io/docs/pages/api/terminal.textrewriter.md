## TextRewriter class

The abstract base class for operations that can be applied by [TextRewriterTransform](./terminal.textrewritertransform.md) .

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare abstract class TextRewriter 
```

## Remarks

The [TextRewriterTransform](./terminal.textrewritertransform.md) applies one or more character rewriting operations to its chunk stream. Since these operations are applied separately to `stderr` and `stdout` , the state is stored in an opaque `TextRewriterState` object.

Conceptually, a `TextRewriter` subclass is very similar to a regular expression, with the difference that `RegExp` operates on a text string, whereas `TextRewriter` operates on a stream of characters.

The two most common subclasses are [NormalizeNewlinesTextRewriter](./terminal.normalizenewlinestextrewriter.md) and [RemoveColorsTextRewriter](./terminal.removecolorstextrewriter.md) .

A rewriting operation starts with `initialize()` , followed by any number of `process()` calls, and then finishes with `close()` . For example:

```ts
const rewriter: NormalizeNewlinesTextRewriter = new NormalizeNewlinesTextRewriter(NewlineKind.Lf);
const state: TextRewriterState = rewriter.initialize();
let output: string = rewriter.process(state, 'line 1\r');
output += rewriter.process(state, '\nline 2\r\n');
output += rewriter.close(state);

// The final "output" value is: "line 1\nline 2\n"
```
After `close()` has been called, the `TextRewriterState` state should not be reused.

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [close(state)](./terminal.textrewriter.close.md) |  | Close the <code>TextRewriterState</code> object and return any buffered output. |
|  [initialize()](./terminal.textrewriter.initialize.md) |  | Create a new <code>TextRewriterState</code> object that can be used to process a stream of characters. |
|  [process(state, input)](./terminal.textrewriter.process.md) |  | Rewrite the next sequence of characters from the input stream, returning the modified output. |
